## Quiz 1 - LLM Reasoning w/ Denny Zhou


### Question 1
What is a major limitation of current large language models (LLMs) when it comes to correcting their own reasoning?
- They often misinterpret prompts
- They struggle to identify and fix their own reasoning errors without external feedback
- They are too slow to process complex reasoning tasks
- They require too much memory to handle reasoning corrections

**Correct answer: "They struggle to identify and fix their own reasoning errors without external feedback"**

A major limitation of large language models (LLMs) is their inability to recognize and correct their own reasoning errors autonomously. They rely heavily on external feedback to identify and address mistakes. This is due to several reasons:

1. LLMs rely on statistical patterns: These models generate responses based on probabilities derived from their training data, not on a deep understanding of logic or reasoning.

2. Lack of self-correction mechanisms: Without intervention (human feedback or external systems), LLMs often fail to reassess their outputs. This can lead to issues like hallucinations, where they confidently provide incorrect or fabricated information.

3. Dependence on external feedback: Techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are essential for fine-tuning models, as they can't independently validate or refine their reasoning.

The other options are incorrect because:

- "They often misinterpret prompts": While misinterpreting complex or ambiguous prompts can occur, it is not specifically related to correcting their reasoning errors.
- "They are too slow to process complex reasoning tasks": Most LLMs process tasks efficiently, though they can be computationally expensive.
- "They require too much memory to handle reasoning corrections": While memory usage is a consideration, it is not the primary limitation in correcting reasoning errors.
